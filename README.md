# Prop Eco Assignment app

This app utilizes the Prop Eco API, feel free to use it!

I have left the GUI pretty straight forward and instead focused my efforts on making a solid back-end, applying theory that I have learned through university and experience
in order to create something robust, scalable, maintainable, efficient and modular.

Everything can be scaled for future features if this app where to be brought further.

# Instructions
