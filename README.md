# Prop Eco Assignment app


Since I've gotten the impression that as an intern I'd be focussing on back-end, I have left the GUI pretty straight forward
and instead focused my efforts on making a solid back-end, applying theory that I have learned through university and experience
in order to create something robust, scalable, maintainable, efficient and modular.

I have also added a simple test to ensure the app is working properly.
Everything can be scaled for future features if this app where to be brought further.


There was a lot of data to be retrieved I thought I would focus on one portion of the data for the sake of time,
I chose national parks. One requirement was to make it fun so I added confetti if a property is located in a national park.

I didn't see it being necessary adding a server-side since I wasn't working with sensitive data however if I were to do it again,
I'd add more security. However this doesn't mean I can't do it, last semester I added a secure server-side to my web project using ajax
which got me a mark of 91%.
